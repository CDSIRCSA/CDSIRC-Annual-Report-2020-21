                        This sixteenth annual report, presented to Parliament by the Child Death and Serious Injury Review Committee, provides highlights of the Committee’s data analyses, reviews of child deaths, and activities undertaken to prevent the death or serious injury of children and young people in similar circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of note in this report is the further decrease in the number and rate of child deaths. In 2019, the number of deaths of children and young people was the lowest recorded for fifteen years. Subsequent analysis found this to be largely due to a reduction in neonatal deaths, although the number of births was not significantly lower than in previous years. In 2020, the number of deaths of children and young people decreased further. Many factors may have contributed to this decline, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the 16-year reporting period to 2020:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The rate of death for Aboriginal children and young people usually resident in South Australia was 66 deaths per 100,000. By comparison, the rate of death for non-Aboriginal children and young people was 27 deaths per 100,000.</li>
                            <li>Sixty-eight percent of child deaths were attributed to illness and disease, and approximately two-thirds of these deaths were of infants less than one year of age.</li>
                            <li>Twenty-two percent of children and young people who died were assigned disability status by the Committee. Families caring for children and young people with disability face significant challenges in accessing services and support for their children. </li>
                            <li>Thirty-nine children aged 0–12 years have died in transport crashes in South Australia, with 64% of these children not properly restrained. Of this 64%, half were aged 7 to 12 years and seated in an adult seat, despite being less than 145 cm tall – the minimum height at which a person can safely use most adult car seats.  </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        Recommendations made by the Committee as part of its reviews have included the need for the whole of Government to provide services that reduce the likelihood of parents experiencing the loss of their children – through death or the child’s entry into state care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In removing a child or young person from their family to the care of the state, the state is responsible for ensuring that the child or young person has better opportunities to live a safer and healthier life than might otherwise have been the case. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Committee used its data to inform its submission to the draft of South Australia’s Road Safety Strategy to 2031 regarding safe restraint of children in vehicles, and the lack of recognition of ‘low speed runovers’. The Committee’s research indicates that low speed runovers, which disproportionately involve large SUVs, may be increasing. Four such deaths occurred in 2019 in South Australia. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Committee endeavours to present the findings of its analyses and reviews to all relevant government and non-government agencies to inform the development of policies and services that impact the lives of children, young people and their families.
