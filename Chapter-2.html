                    <h3>2.4. The ANZCDR & PG</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Committee continues to support the work of the Australian and New Zealand Child Death Review and Prevention Group. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In May 2021, members of the Secretariat and the Committee attended various sessions held over the course of the virtual, annual two-day meeting. In an update from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the contribution of the Committee to the ABS’s work in seeking to provide more psycho-social context to its data was acknowledged.  Various jurisdictions expressed interest in the work the Committee was undertaking to analyse and review the ‘manner’ of children’s deaths. The Committee will report back on its progress with this analysis at the ANZCDR & PG 2022 meeting.  It has also agreed to form part of a sub-committee that will continue to explore the development of a national database of child deaths.
